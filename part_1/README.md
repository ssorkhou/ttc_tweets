# Sentiment Analysis of #TTC Tweets
This folder contains Part 1 of my project in which I perform sentiment analysis on tweets with the #TTC hashtag. Tweets were scraped using the development version of [snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape). All tweets feature the #TTC hashtag and originate from a location within 50 km of Toronto. We restrict our attention to the tweets between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2021, inclusive, since this is the range for which TTC transit delay data is publically available.

This folder consists of the following files:

* Sentiment Analysis of #TTC Tweets - Part 1 of 3.ipynb
  * The Jupyter notebook in which I go through the first part of this project.
* tweets_xxxx.csv
  * There are eight files in this format. The xxxx is a year from 2014 to 2021 inclusive and each file contains the scraped Twitter data of tweets from that year.
