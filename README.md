# #TTC Tweets
I conduct sentiment analysis on tweets featuring the #TTC hashtag originating from the Toronto area. The Twitter data is highly informative and I was able to uncover some interesting trends, including the fact that positive tweets on average were liked and retweeted more often than negative ones. Plenty of additional findings are discussed in the project.

Furthermore, I examine data pertaining to scheduled subway closures as well as bus, streetcar, and subway delays. After exploring these datasets I attempt to discover any relationships between these datasets and the Twitter data. I must admit that the results here are rather surprising to me as subway closures and transit delays have less of an impact on Twitter sentiment than I anticipated.

The project is split into three parts. In the first I investigate the Twitter data on its own, in the second part I introduce the subway closure data, and in the third I also investigate data relating to transit delays. Thus the project consists of three Jupyter notebooks, with each part relegated to its own folder in this repository. For each notebook there is the possibility to follow along interactively via Binder if you so choose.
