# #TTC Tweets
I conduct sentiment analysis on tweets featuring the #TTC hashtag originating from the Toronto area. The Twitter data is highly informative and I was able to uncover some interesting trends, including the fact that positive tweets on average were liked and retweeted more often than negative ones. Plenty of additional findings are discussed in the project.

Furthermore, I examine data pertaining to scheduled subway closures as well as bus, streetcar, and subway delays. After exploring these datasets I attempt to discover any relationships between these datasets and the Twitter data. I must admit that the results here are rather surprising to me as subway closures and transit delays have less of an impact on Twitter sentiment than I anticipated.

The project is split into three parts. In the first I investigate the Twitter data on its own, in the second part I introduce the subway closure data, and in the third I also investigate data relating to transit delays. Thus the project consists of three Jupyter notebooks. You can follow along interactively if you choose via Binder.

This repository is organized in the following manner. The three Jupyter notebooks can be directly found in this repository. Additionally, there are three folders:

* tweets - contains the scraped tweets as csv files
* closures - contains the csv file with the subway closure data
* delays - this folder has the three csv files pertaining to bus, streetcar, and subway delays.
